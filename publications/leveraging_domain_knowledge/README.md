# Leveraging Domain Knowledge to improve EM image segmentation with Lifted Multicuts

Experiments for the publication [Leveraging Domain Knowledge to improve EM image segmentation with Lifted Multicuts](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10535.pdf).
We provide four different examples that show how to map biological knowledge from different sources to lifted edges in order to improve boundary based instacne segmentation and an additional experiment to investigate the approximate lifted multicut solver introduced in the paper:

1. Based on axon / dendrite attribution in EM image volume of mouse cortex.
2. Based on false merge detection in EM image volume of drosophila neural tissue.
3. Based on instance segmentation of organells in EM image volume of sponge choanocyte.
4. Based on nucleus instance segmentation in LM image volume of primordia roots. 
5. Additional experiments for new lifted multicut solver.

TODO explain from where to get the data for the experiments.
